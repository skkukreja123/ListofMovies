get_it â€“ Dependency Injection
This app uses the get_it package to manage dependencies cleanly and efficiently. It registers and provides instances like network checkers, services, and view models throughout the app.

Why?

Decouples object creation from usage

Enables easier testing and mocking

Centralized configuration


This app uses the provider package to manage UI state through the ViewModel (MovieViewModel). This ensures a reactive UI that responds to loading, success, and error states.

Why?

Easy to use and efficient

Encourages MVVM structure

Great for listening to and updating UI state
